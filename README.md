- âš¡ Fun fact:The first computer bug was an actual bug! In 1947,
- while working on the Harvard Mark II computer, engineers found
- a moth stuck in a relay, causing a malfunction. They logged it as the
- "first actual case of bug being found" and taped it into their logbook.
- This incident is often credited with popularizing the term "debugging" for fixing computer glitches.
